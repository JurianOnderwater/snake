# Snake AI
This is a snake game I made using a tutorial, implementing the AI (ai.py) myself. 

The 'AI' is a simple search algorithm searching for the fastest way to the food and following this route. The performance is not optimal, as the snake does not take into account its own tail yet, however this could be implemented.

The script to run this simulation:
```
python3 snake.py
```


This was one of my first projects in python.
